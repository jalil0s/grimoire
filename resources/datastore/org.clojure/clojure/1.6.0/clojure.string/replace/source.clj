(defn ^String replace
  "Replaces all instance of match with replacement in s.

   match/replacement can be:

   string / string
   char / char
   pattern / (string or function of match).

   See also replace-first.

   The replacement is literal (i.e. none of its characters are treated
   specially) for all cases above except pattern / string.

   For pattern / string, $1, $2, etc. in the replacement string are
   substituted with the string that matched the corresponding
   parenthesized group in the pattern.  If you wish your replacement
   string r to be used literally, use (re-quote-replacement r) as the
   replacement argument.  See also documentation for
   java.util.regex.Matcher's appendReplacement method.

   Example:
   (clojure.string/replace \"Almost Pig Latin\" #\"\\b(\\w)(\\w+)\\b\" \"$2$1ay\")
   -> \"lmostAay igPay atinLay\""
  {:added "1.2"}
  [^CharSequence s match replacement]
  (let [s (.toString s)]
    (cond 
     (instance? Character match) (.replace s ^Character match ^Character replacement)
     (instance? CharSequence match) (.replace s ^CharSequence match ^CharSequence replacement)
     (instance? Pattern match) (if (instance? CharSequence replacement)
                                 (.replaceAll (re-matcher ^Pattern match s)
                                              (.toString ^CharSequence replacement))
                                 (replace-by s match replacement))
     :else (throw (IllegalArgumentException. (str "Invalid match arg: " match))))))
