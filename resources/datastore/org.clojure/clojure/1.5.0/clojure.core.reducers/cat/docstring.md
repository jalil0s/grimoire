  A high-performance combining fn that yields the catenation of the
  reduced values. The result is reducible, foldable, seqable and
  counted, providing the identity collections are reducible, seqable
  and counted. The single argument version will build a combining fn
  with the supplied identity constructor. Tests for identity
  with (zero? (count x)). See also foldcat.
