(defn skip-if-eol
  "If the next character on stream s is a newline, skips it, otherwise
  leaves the stream untouched. Returns :line-start, :stream-end, or :body
  to indicate the relative location of the next character on s. The stream
  must either be an instance of LineNumberingPushbackReader or duplicate
  its behavior of both supporting .unread and collapsing all of CR, LF, and
  CRLF to a single \\newline."
