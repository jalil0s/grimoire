(defmacro condp
  "Takes a binary predicate, an expression, and a set of clauses.
  Each clause can take the form of either:

  test-expr result-expr

  test-expr :>> result-fn

  Note :>> is an ordinary keyword.

  For each clause, (pred test-expr expr) is evaluated. If it returns
  logical true, the clause is a match. If a binary clause matches, the
  result-expr is returned, if a ternary clause matches, its result-fn,
  which must be a unary function, is called with the result of the
  predicate as its argument, the result of that call being the return
  value of condp. A single default expression can follow the clauses,
  and its value will be returned if no clause matches. If no default
  expression is provided and no clause matches, an
  IllegalArgumentException is thrown."
