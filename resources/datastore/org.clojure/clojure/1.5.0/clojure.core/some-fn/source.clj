  "Takes a set of predicates and returns a function f that returns the first logical true value
  returned by one of its composing predicates against any of its arguments, else it returns
  logical false. Note that f is short-circuiting in that it will stop execution on the first
  argument that triggers a logical true result against the original predicates."
