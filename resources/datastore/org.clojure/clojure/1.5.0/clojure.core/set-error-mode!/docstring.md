  Sets the error-mode of agent a to mode-keyword, which must be
  either :fail or :continue.  If an action being run by the agent
  throws an exception or doesn't pass the validator fn, an
  error-handler may be called (see set-error-handler!), after which,
  if the mode is :continue, the agent will continue as if neither the
  action that caused the error nor the error itself ever happened.
  
  If the mode is :fail, the agent will become failed and will stop
  accepting new 'send' and 'send-off' actions, and any previously
  queued actions will be held until a 'restart-agent'.  Deref will
  still work, returning the state of the agent before the error.
