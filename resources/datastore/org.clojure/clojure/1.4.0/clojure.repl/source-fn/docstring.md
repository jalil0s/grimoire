  Returns a string of the source code for the given symbol, if it can
  find it.  This requires that the symbol resolve to a Var defined in
  a namespace for which the .clj is in the classpath.  Returns nil if
  it can't find the source.  For most REPL usage, 'source' is more
  convenient.

  Example: (source-fn 'filter)
