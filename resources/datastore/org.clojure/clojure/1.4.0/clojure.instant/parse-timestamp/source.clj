(def parse-timestamp
     "Parse a string containing an RFC3339-like like timestamp.

The function new-instant is called with the following arguments.

                min  max           default
                ---  ------------  -------
  years          0           9999      N/A (s must provide years)
  months         1             12        1
  days           1             31        1 (actual max days depends
  hours          0             23        0  on month and year)
  minutes        0             59        0
  seconds        0             60        0 (though 60 is only valid
  nanoseconds    0      999999999        0  when minutes is 59)
  offset-sign   -1              1        0
  offset-hours   0             23        0
  offset-minutes 0             59        0

These are all integers and will be non-nil. (The listed defaults
will be passed if the corresponding field is not present in s.)

Grammar (of s):

  date-fullyear   = 4DIGIT
  date-month      = 2DIGIT  ; 01-12
  date-mday       = 2DIGIT  ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on
                            ; month/year
  time-hour       = 2DIGIT  ; 00-23
  time-minute     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-59
  time-second     = 2DIGIT  ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on leap second
                            ; rules
  time-secfrac    = '.' 1*DIGIT
  time-numoffset  = ('+' / '-') time-hour ':' time-minute
  time-offset     = 'Z' / time-numoffset

  time-part       = time-hour [ ':' time-minute [ ':' time-second
                    [time-secfrac] [time-offset] ] ]

  timestamp       = date-year [ '-' date-month [ '-' date-mday
                    [ 'T' time-part ] ] ]

Unlike RFC3339:

  - we only parse the timestamp format
  - timestamp can elide trailing components
  - time-offset is optional (defaults to +00:00)

Though time-offset is syntactically optional, a missing time-offset
will be treated as if the time-offset zero (+00:00) had been
specified.
