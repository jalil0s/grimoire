  Creates and interns a global var with the name
  of symbol in the current namespace (*ns*) or locates such a var if
  it already exists.  If init is supplied, it is evaluated, and the
  root binding of the var is set to the resulting value.  If init is
  not supplied, the root binding of the var is unaffected.
