  Creates a new vector of a single primitive type t, where t is one
  of :int :long :float :double :byte :short :char or :boolean. The
  resulting vector complies with the interface of vectors in general,
  but stores the values unboxed internally.

  Optionally takes one or more elements to populate the vector.
